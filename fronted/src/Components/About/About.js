      <p className='about-para'>Hey there! I'm diving headfirst into the exciting world of web development. While I may be a beginner in this expansive  field, I've already started making waves by crafting websites for small businesses. Each project is not just an opportunity to create something beautiful but also a chance to learn and grow. Currently pursuing my studies in BCCA, I'm dedicated to expanding my  knowledge and skills, eager to push the boundaries of what I can achieve. Join me on this journey as we explore the boundless possibilities of the digital landscape together.</p>
